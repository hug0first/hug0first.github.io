# photo_website

This is the repo for my photo website. 
The plan is to eventually be able to sell prints of my photos from the site as well. 
Currently it just acts as a gallery with a short about page and an in construction print shop page.
Currently it only plays nicely on traditional desktop browsers, I've tried it on mobile and the formatting has trouble.

My plan for the future is to add mobile compatibility so that it should be able to work relatively seamlessly on all browsers.
